                <strong>Human remains found on a glacier close to Switzerland's famous Matterhorn have been
                    confirmed to be
                    the
                    body of a German climber missing since 1986.</strong>
                The discovery is the latest in a number of long held secrets that the Alpine glaciers, now rapidly
                shrinking
                due to
                climate change, have revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The body was discovered earlier this month by climbers crossing the Theodul glacier above Zermatt.
            </p>
            <p>
                They noticed a hiking boot and crampons emerging from the ice.
            </p>
            <p>
                DNA analysis showed the body to be that of a German climber, who disappeared 37 years ago. A huge search
                and
                rescue
                operation at the time failed to find any trace of him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Police did not name the climber but said he was aged 38 when he went missing during a hike.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Theodul glacier, like glaciers across the Alps, has shown a marked retreat in the last few years. It
                is
                part of
                Zermatt's famous year round ski region, the highest in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the alpine ice fields are especially sensitive to global warming. Until the 1980s the Theodul was
                still
                connected to
                its neighbour - the Gorner glacier - but the two have now split apart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost every summer, the melting ice reveals something, or someone, lost for decades. Last year the
                wreckage
                of a plane
                that crashed in 1968 emerged from the Aletsch glacier.

            <p>
                In 2014 the body of missing British climber Jonathan Conville was discovered by a helicopter pilot who
                spotted something
                unusual while delivering supplies to a mountain refuge on the Matterhorn - Switzerland's most famous
                peak.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr Conville had been missing since 1979. His family, who had spent decades not knowing his fate,
                described finally being
                able to be sure that he had died in an environment he loved as "bittersweet".
            </p>
            <p>
                A year later, the bodies of two Japanese climbers were discovered at the edge of the Matterhorn glacier.
                They had gone
                missing in a snowstorm in 1970.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last year the melting ice even changed the border between Switzerland and Italy. The frontier had
                originally been set at
                the drainage divide - the point that meltwater runs down towards one country or the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                The shrinking glacier meant the position of the drainage divide shifted. The famous Rifugio Guide del
                Cervino, an
                Italian mountain lodge much loved by skiers and hikers, is now technically in Switzerland, and delicate
                negotiations
                between the Swiss and Italian governments have been taking place to decide how to redraw the border.
